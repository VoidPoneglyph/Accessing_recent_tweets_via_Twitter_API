This code requires the API keys from twitter development application.
Using the keys, we create an object called "authenticate" which we then use to access data from tweets on twitter. This data will be needed for the Sentiment analysis project.
In this specific programme, we extract the first 5 recent tweets from Bill Gates twitter handle. This ensures that we access to the needed data and will enable us to continue with this project.
