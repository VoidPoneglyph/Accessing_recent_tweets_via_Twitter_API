In the above project, we use Twitter API keys to access tweets from specific twitter handles. In this case, we're extracting tweets from the official Bill Gates twitter handle.
We create an object called "authenticate" that enables us to input the confidential keys and tokens to access the information we need to kickstart Sentiment Analysis.
Here, we print out the 5 most recent tweets from Bill Gates to ensure we have access to the twitter API.
